She related to them all that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her great riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go and try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the well and spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a thorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then she threw it into the well, and jumped in herself.</p><p>Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it till she came to the oven. &lsquo;Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,&rsquo; cried the loaves as before.</p></div> </div>
