It would not stop and come with us.&rsquo; But the little peasant said: &lsquo;Oh, but I must have my beast back again.&rsquo; Then they went back to the meadow together, but someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone. The cow-herd said: &lsquo;It must have run away.&rsquo; The peasant, however, said: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that,&rsquo; and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.</p><p>And now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had so long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for it, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed.</p></div> </div>
