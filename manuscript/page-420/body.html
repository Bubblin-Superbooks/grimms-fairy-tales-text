<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his wife&rsquo;s daughters what he should bring them. &lsquo;Fine clothes,&rsquo; said the first; &lsquo;Pearls and diamonds,&rsquo; cried the second. &lsquo;Now, child,&rsquo; said he to his own daughter, &lsquo;what will you have?&rsquo; &lsquo;The first twig, dear father, that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come homewards,&rsquo; said she. Then he bought for the first two the fine clothes and pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he rode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against him, and almost pushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he got home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it, and went to her mother&rsquo;s grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was watered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree.</p></div> </div>
