<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> you walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry.&rsquo;</p><p>Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought: &lsquo;Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time&rsquo;; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.</p></div> </div>
