What would I give to have such a prize!&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the shepherd, &lsquo;if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your horse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it myself.&rsquo; &lsquo;Done!&rsquo; said Hans, merrily. &lsquo;What a noble heart that good man has!&rsquo; thought he. Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse, wished Hans and the cow good morning, and away he rode.</p><p>Hans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and then drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky one.</p></div> </div>
