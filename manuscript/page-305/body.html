<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through a crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well suppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his axe, and gave his wife a scythe. &lsquo;Do you stay behind,&rsquo; said the woodman, &lsquo;and when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with the scythe.&rsquo; Tom heard all this, and cried out, &lsquo;Father, father! I am here, the wolf has swallowed me.&rsquo; And his father said, &lsquo;Heaven be praised! we have found our dear child again&rsquo;; and he told his wife not to use the scythe for fear she should hurt him. Then he aimed a great blow, and struck the wolf on the head, and killed him on the spot! and when he was dead they cut open his body, and set Tommy free.</p></div> </div>
