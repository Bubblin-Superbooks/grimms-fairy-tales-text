But when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another, who so fascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl remained there a long time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and changed herself into a flower, and thought: &lsquo;Someone will surely come this way, and trample me down.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
