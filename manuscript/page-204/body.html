<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &lsquo;Now, this jam shall be blessed by God,&rsquo; cried the little tailor, &lsquo;and give me health and strength&rsquo;; so he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself a piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it. &lsquo;This won&rsquo;t taste bitter,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but I will just finish the jacket before I take a bite.&rsquo; He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made bigger and bigger stitches. In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam rose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were attracted and descended on it in hosts. &lsquo;Hi! who invited you?&rsquo; said the little tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away. The flies, however, who understood no German, would not be turned away, but came back again in ever-increasing companies.</p></div> </div>
