So he began, and told all the story of the princess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the true waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would behave thus. &lsquo;Nothing better,&rsquo; said this false bride, &lsquo;than that she should be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that two white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from street to street till she was dead.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thou art she!&rsquo; said the old king; &lsquo;and as thou has judged thyself, so shall it be done to thee.&rsquo; And the young king was then married to his true wife, and they reigned over the kingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good fairy came to see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life again.</p></div> </div>
