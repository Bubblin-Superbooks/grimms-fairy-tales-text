<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Some time afterwards Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish of fish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a large grasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in. They ran to it and found it was the dwarf. &lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; said Rose-red; &lsquo;you surely don&rsquo;t want to go into the water?&rsquo; &lsquo;I am not such a fool!&rsquo; cried the dwarf; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you see that the accursed fish wants to pull me in?&rsquo; The little man had been sitting there fishing, and unluckily the wind had tangled up his beard with the fishing-line; a moment later a big fish made a bite and the feeble creature had not strength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the dwarf towards him.</p></div> </div>
