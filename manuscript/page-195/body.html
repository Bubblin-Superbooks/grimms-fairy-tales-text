<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as he entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were there. He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree, and at the top of this a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallen asleep under the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen it in her arms, had flown down, snatched it away, and set it on the high tree.</p><p>The forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to himself: &lsquo;You will take him home with you, and bring him up with your Lina.&rsquo; He took it home, therefore, and the two children grew up together. And the one, which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel, because a bird had carried it away. Fundevogel and Lina loved each other so dearly that when they did not see each other they were sad.</p></div> </div>
