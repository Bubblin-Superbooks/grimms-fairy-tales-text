<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him nothing more to eat, and said, &lsquo;I want you no longer, so take yourself off out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are stronger than a lion.&rsquo; Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.</p><p>The poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the wood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently a fox met him: &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, my friend?&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;why do you hang down your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; replied the horse, &lsquo;justice and avarice never dwell in one house;</p></div> </div>
