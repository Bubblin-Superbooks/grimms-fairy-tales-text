I am quite innocent. He was standing there by night like one intent on doing evil. I did not know who it was, and I entreated him three times either to speak or to go away.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said the father, &lsquo;I have nothing but unhappiness with you. Go out of my sight. I will see you no more.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day. Then will I go forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate, understand one art which will support me.&rsquo; &lsquo;Learn what you will,&rsquo; spoke the father, &lsquo;it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers for you.</p></div> </div>
