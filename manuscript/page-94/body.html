<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&rsquo; So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf, till at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the sparrow, &lsquo;you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to the next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.&rsquo; When the dog had eaten this too, the sparrow said to him, &lsquo;Well, my good friend, have you had enough now?&rsquo; &lsquo;I have had plenty of meat,&rsquo; answered he, &lsquo;but I should like to have a piece of bread to eat after it.&rsquo; &lsquo;Come with me then,&rsquo; said the sparrow, &lsquo;and you shall soon have that too.</p></div> </div>
