But when she was led in she ate nothing, and said: &lsquo;The gracious and merciful God who has supported me in the tower, will soon set me free.&rsquo; She lived three days more, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white doves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of heaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. The aged king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the king&rsquo;s own heart, and he soon died. His son married the beautiful maiden whom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket, and whether they are still alive or not, is known to God.</p></div> </div>
