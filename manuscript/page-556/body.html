But the fox managed to tie his legs together and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he could not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped the horse on the shoulder, and said, &lsquo;Jip! Dobbin! Jip!&rsquo; Then up he sprang, and moved off, dragging the lion behind him.</p></div> </div>
