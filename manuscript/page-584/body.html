He found it situated, however, on a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot he saw the enchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside. He was overjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but the sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he fell back again. When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was greatly grieved, and said to himself, &lsquo;I will remain here and wait for her,&rsquo; so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for a whole year, and every day he saw the king&rsquo;s daughter driving round her castle, but still was unable to get nearer to her.</p></div> </div>
