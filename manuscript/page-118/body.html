What does your wife want?&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the fisherman, &lsquo;she says that when I had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let you go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants a snug little cottage.&rsquo; &lsquo;Go home, then,&rsquo; said the fish; &lsquo;she is in the cottage already!&rsquo; So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the door of a nice trim little cottage. &lsquo;Come in, come in!&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;is not this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?&rsquo; And there was a parlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there was a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and there was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens.</p></div> </div>
