<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said, &lsquo;Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?&rsquo; &lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;what can you do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.&rsquo; The frog said, &lsquo;I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes; but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball again.&rsquo; &lsquo;What nonsense,&rsquo; thought the princess, &lsquo;this silly frog is talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he shall have what he asks.&rsquo; So she said to the frog, &lsquo;Well, if you will bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.</p></div> </div>
