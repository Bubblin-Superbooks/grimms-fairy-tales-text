When the brother came home, they asked him about the castle of Stromberg, and he told them he would look on his own maps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger. Accordingly, when he had finished his supper, they all went up together to his room and looked through his maps, but the castle was not to be found. Then he fetched other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until at last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away. &lsquo;How shall I be able to get there?&rsquo; asked the man. &lsquo;I have two hours to spare,&rsquo; said the giant, &lsquo;and I will carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle; I must then return to look after the child who is in our care.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
