<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But there was no princess in the world so beautiful; and if there had been, still there was not one to be found who had golden hair. So the messengers came home, and had had all their trouble for nothing.</p><p>Now the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up, the king looked at her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to his courtiers, &lsquo;May I not marry my daughter? She is the very image of my dead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole earth, and you say there must be a queen.&rsquo; When the courtiers heard this they were shocked, and said, &lsquo;Heaven forbid that a father should marry his daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can come.</p></div> </div>
