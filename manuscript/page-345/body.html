When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had happened. &lsquo;My stars!&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;what shall I do to keep Frederick from seeing all this slopping about?&rsquo; So she thought a while; and at last remembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair, and that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale nicely. &lsquo;What a lucky thing,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;that we kept that meal! we have now a good use for it.&rsquo; So away she went for it: but she managed to set it down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus all the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. &lsquo;Ah! well,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;when one goes another may as well follow.</p></div> </div>
