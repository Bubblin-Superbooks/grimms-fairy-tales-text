When he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite; and at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to kill his brother.</p><p>So he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to lie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, &lsquo;Dear brother, I have found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between us.&rsquo; The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out together, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed out upon him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree.</p></div> </div>
