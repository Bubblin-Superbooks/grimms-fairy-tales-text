<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&rsquo; Now there was a sword that cut off an enemy&rsquo;s head whenever the wearer gave the words, &lsquo;Heads off!&rsquo;; a cloak that made the owner invisible, or gave him any form he pleased; and a pair of boots that carried the wearer wherever he wished. Heinel said they must first let him try these wonderful things, then he might know how to set a value upon them. Then they gave him the cloak, and he wished himself a fly, and in a moment he was a fly. &lsquo;The cloak is very well,&rsquo; said he: &lsquo;now give me the sword.&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said they; &lsquo;not unless you undertake not to say, &ldquo;Heads off!&rdquo; for if you do we are all dead men.&rsquo; So they gave it him, charging him to try it on a tree. He next asked for the boots also; and the moment he had all three in his power, he wished himself at the Golden Mountain; and there he was at once. So the giants were left behind with no goods to share or quarrel about.</p></div> </div>
