<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Alas, alas!&rsquo; said Hans, &lsquo;who would have thought it? What a shame to take my horse, and give me only a dry cow! If I kill her, what will she be good for? I hate cow-beef; it is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig now&mdash;like that fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease&mdash;one could do something with it; it would at any rate make sausages.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the butcher, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind, neighbourly thing. To please you I will change, and give you my fine fat pig for the cow.&rsquo; &lsquo;Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!&rsquo; said Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the wheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to its leg.</p></div> </div>
