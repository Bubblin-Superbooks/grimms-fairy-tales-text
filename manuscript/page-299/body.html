<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug place to finish his night&rsquo;s rest in; so he laid himself down, meaning to sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and mother. But alas! how woefully he was undone! what crosses and sorrows happen to us all in this world! The cook got up early, before daybreak, to feed the cows; and going straight to the hay-loft, carried away a large bundle of hay, with the little man in the middle of it, fast asleep. He still, however, slept on, and did not awake till he found himself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the cow&rsquo;s rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it.</p></div> </div>
