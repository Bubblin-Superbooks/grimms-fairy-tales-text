The mother said: &lsquo;Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking shelter.&rsquo; Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a poor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door.</p><p>Rose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered, and Snow-white hid herself behind her mother&rsquo;s bed. But the bear began to speak and said: &lsquo;Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm! I am half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
