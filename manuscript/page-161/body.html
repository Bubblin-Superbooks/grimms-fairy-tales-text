As she looked very pretty, and too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber to ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left standing in the court below. &lsquo;I brought her with me for the sake of her company on the road,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;pray give the girl some work to do, that she may not be idle.&rsquo; The old king could not for some time think of any work for her to do; but at last he said, &lsquo;I have a lad who takes care of my geese; she may go and help him.&rsquo; Now the name of this lad, that the real bride was to help in watching the king&rsquo;s geese, was Curdken.</p></div> </div>
