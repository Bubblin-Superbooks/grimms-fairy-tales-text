The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and ate and drank to his heart&rsquo;s content. When he had finished his supper the man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg. The giant said, &lsquo;I will look on my map; on it are marked all the towns, villages, and houses.&rsquo; So he fetched his map, and looked for the castle, but could not find it. &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I have larger maps upstairs in the cupboard, we will look on those,&rsquo; but they searched in vain, for the castle was not marked even on these.</p></div> </div>
