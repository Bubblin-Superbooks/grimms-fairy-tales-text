Thereupon she took her leave of her father, and rode away with them, and rode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly. Then she asked if he required any huntsmen, and if he would take all of them into his service. The king looked at her and did not know her, but as they were such handsome fellows, he said: &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and that he would willingly take them, and now they were the king&rsquo;s twelve huntsmen.</p></div> </div>
