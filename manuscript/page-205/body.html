When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer than seven, dead and with legs stretched out. &lsquo;Are you a fellow of that sort?&rsquo; said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery. &lsquo;The whole town shall know of this!&rsquo; And the little tailor hastened to cut himself a girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters: &lsquo;Seven at one stroke!&rsquo; &lsquo;What, the town!&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;the whole world shall hear of it!&rsquo; and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb&rsquo;s tail. The tailor put on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he thought his workshop was too small for his valour.</p></div> </div>
