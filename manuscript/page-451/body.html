<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>So now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at it and said: &lsquo;Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother has come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the forest with her.&rsquo; The little kids cried: &lsquo;First show us your paws that we may know if you are our dear little mother.&rsquo; Then he put his paws in through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they believed that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should come in but the wolf! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves. One sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But the wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the other he swallowed them down his throat.</p></div> </div>
