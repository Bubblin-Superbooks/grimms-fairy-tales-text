<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The youth made over his three-legged horse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the soldiers. When he got near the battlefield a great part of the king&rsquo;s men had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give way. Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like a hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him. They began to flee, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there was not a single man left. Instead of returning to the king, however, he conducted his troop by byways back to the forest, and called forth Iron Hans. &lsquo;What do you desire?&rsquo; asked the wild man. &lsquo;Take back your horse and your troops, and give me my three-legged horse again.&rsquo; All that he asked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse.</p></div> </div>
