<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It was not long before the witch came striding up towards them, and said to the musician: &lsquo;Dear musician, may I pluck that beautiful flower for myself?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;I will play to you while you do it.&rsquo; As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was just going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who the flower was, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was forced to dance, for it was a magical dance. The faster he played, the more violent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes from her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he did not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.</p></div> </div>
