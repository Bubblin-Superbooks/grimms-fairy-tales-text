So the cow was killed, and cut up; and the stomach, in which Tom lay, was thrown out upon a dunghill.</p><p>Tom soon set himself to work to get out, which was not a very easy task; but at last, just as he had made room to get his head out, fresh ill-luck befell him. A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up the whole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away.</p></div> </div>
