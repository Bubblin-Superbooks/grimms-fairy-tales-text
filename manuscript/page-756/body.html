<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>After a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook to let her go up and see it as before. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but come again in half an hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.&rsquo; Then she ran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress out which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in, looking like a king&rsquo;s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at seeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her. After the dance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the king did not see where she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin, and made herself into Cat-skin again, and went into the kitchen to cook the soup.</p></div> </div>
