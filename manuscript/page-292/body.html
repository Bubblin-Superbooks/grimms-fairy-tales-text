<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &lsquo;What an odd thing that is!&rsquo; said one: &lsquo;there is a cart going along, and I hear a carter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no one.&rsquo; &lsquo;That is queer, indeed,&rsquo; said the other; &lsquo;let us follow the cart, and see where it goes.&rsquo; So they went on into the wood, till at last they came to the place where the woodman was. Then Tom Thumb, seeing his father, cried out, &lsquo;See, father, here I am with the cart, all right and safe! now take me down!&rsquo; So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with the other took his son out of the horse&rsquo;s ear, and put him down upon a straw, where he sat as merry as you please.</p></div> </div>
