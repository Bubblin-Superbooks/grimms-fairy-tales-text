The guards that stood at the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth was, that she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress, blackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was Cat-skin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began to rake the ashes, the cook said, &lsquo;Let that alone till the morning, and heat the king&rsquo;s soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but take care you don&rsquo;t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of never eating again.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
