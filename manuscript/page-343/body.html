<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was Catherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said. &lsquo;Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be hungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.&rsquo; &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;it shall all be ready.&rsquo; When dinner-time drew nigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and put it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to crackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it: then she said to herself, &lsquo;The steak is almost ready, I may as well go to the cellar for the ale.&rsquo; So she left the pan on the fire and took a large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran into the jug and Catherine stood looking on.</p></div> </div>
