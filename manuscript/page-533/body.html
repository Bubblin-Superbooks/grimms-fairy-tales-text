<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> therefore she ought to be mine.&rsquo; &lsquo;Your seeing her would have been of no use,&rsquo; said the thief, &lsquo;if I had not taken her away from the dragon; therefore she ought to be mine.&rsquo; &lsquo;No, she is mine,&rsquo; said the huntsman; &lsquo;for if I had not killed the dragon, he would, after all, have torn you and the princess into pieces.&rsquo; &lsquo;And if I had not sewn the boat together again,&rsquo; said the tailor, &lsquo;you would all have been drowned, therefore she is mine.&rsquo; Then the king put in a word, and said, &lsquo;Each of you is right; and as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of you to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great deal better. But to make up for your loss, I will give each of you, as a reward for his skill, half a kingdom.</p></div> </div>
