<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: &lsquo;Now, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not be cold.&rsquo; Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very high, the woman said: &lsquo;Now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we have done, we will come back and fetch you away.&rsquo;</p><p>Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards.</p></div> </div>
