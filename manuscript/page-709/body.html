My dead cousin was here, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down below, but no one told me what it was to shudder.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the king, &lsquo;you have saved the castle, and shall marry my daughter.&rsquo; &lsquo;That is all very well,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but still I do not know what it is to shudder!&rsquo;</p><p>Then the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever much the young king loved his wife, and however happy he was, he still said always: &lsquo;If I could but shudder&mdash;if I could but shudder.&rsquo; And this at last angered her.</p></div> </div>
