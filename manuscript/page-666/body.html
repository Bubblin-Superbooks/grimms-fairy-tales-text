But one of the good qualities which old Mr Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and the cat had continually to send the suitors away. At length came a young fox. Then Mrs Fox said: &lsquo;Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has a little pointed mouth?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the cat, &lsquo;he has.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then let him come upstairs,&rsquo; said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding feast.</p></div> </div>
