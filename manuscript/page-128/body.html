Then they went to bed: but Dame Ilsabill could not sleep all night for thinking what she should be next. At last, as she was dropping asleep, morning broke, and the sun rose. &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; thought she, as she woke up and looked at it through the window, &lsquo;after all I cannot prevent the sun rising.&rsquo; At this thought she was very angry, and wakened her husband, and said, &lsquo;Husband, go to the fish and tell him I must be lord of the sun and moon.&rsquo; The fisherman was half asleep, but the thought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed. &lsquo;Alas, wife!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;cannot you be easy with being pope?&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my leave. Go to the fish at once!&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
