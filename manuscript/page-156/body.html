This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and her mother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her. And there was a good fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch over her. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a great way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she got ready to set off on her journey to his country.

And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give her into the bridegroom&rsquo;s hands; and each had a horse for the journey. Now the princess&rsquo;s horse was the fairy&rsquo;s gift, and it was called Falada, and could speak.</p></div> </div>
