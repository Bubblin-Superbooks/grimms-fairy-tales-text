I shall put them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you never go near or meddle with them.&rsquo; &lsquo;No, Frederick,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;that I never will.&rsquo; As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy. &lsquo;Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if you had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yellow buttons!&rsquo; said they: &lsquo;let us have a look at them.&rsquo; &lsquo;Go into the garden and dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow buttons: I dare not go myself.</p></div> </div>
