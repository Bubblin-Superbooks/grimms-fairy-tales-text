<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that, was quite happy and thought: &lsquo;You certainly are a pretty girl!&rsquo; And when she came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine, and as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she was cooking until she was satisfied, and said: &lsquo;The cook must know what the food is like.&rsquo;</p><p>It came to pass that the master one day said to her: &lsquo;Gretel, there is a guest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.&rsquo; &lsquo;I will see to it, master,&rsquo; answered Gretel. She killed two fowls, scalded them, plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before the fire, that they might roast.</p></div> </div>
