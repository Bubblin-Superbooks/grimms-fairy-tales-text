They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in somewhere.&rsquo; Then she said: &lsquo;Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is eaten you will have some peace, why should God&rsquo;s good gifts be spoilt?&rsquo; So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the one chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed down, and still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said: &lsquo;What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what&rsquo;s right for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take another draught it would do me no harm.&rsquo; So she took another hearty drink, and let the second chicken follow the first.</p></div> </div>
