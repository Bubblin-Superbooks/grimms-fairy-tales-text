<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>An aged count once lived in Switzerland, who had an only son, but he was stupid, and could learn nothing. Then said the father: &lsquo;Hark you, my son, try as I will I can get nothing into your head. You must go from hence, I will give you into the care of a celebrated master, who shall see what he can do with you.&rsquo; The youth was sent into a strange town, and remained a whole year with the master. At the end of this time, he came home again, and his father asked: &lsquo;Now, my son, what have you learnt?&rsquo; &lsquo;Father, I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark.&rsquo; &lsquo;Lord have mercy on us!&rsquo; cried the father; &lsquo;is that all you have learnt? I will send you into another town, to another master.&rsquo; The youth was taken thither, and stayed a year with this master likewise.</p></div> </div>
