HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF</p><p>Another day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountains to eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found should be shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a very large nut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it all to herself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it stuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to Chanticleer, &lsquo;Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I shall be choked.&rsquo; Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river, and said, &lsquo;River, give me some water, for Partlet lies in the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.&rsquo; The river said, &lsquo;Run first to the bride, and ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water.</p></div> </div>
