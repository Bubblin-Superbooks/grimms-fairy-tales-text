The children must go, we will take them farther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other means of saving ourselves!&rsquo; The man&rsquo;s heart was heavy, and he thought: &lsquo;It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your children.&rsquo; The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise, and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time also.</p></div> </div>
