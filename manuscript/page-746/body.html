<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and was so beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of the earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her end drew near she called the king to her and said, &lsquo;Promise me that you will never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful as I am, and who has golden hair like mine.&rsquo; Then when the king in his grief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died. But the king was not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking another wife. At last, however, his wise men said, &lsquo;this will not do; the king must marry again, that we may have a queen.&rsquo; So messengers were sent far and wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen.</p></div> </div>
