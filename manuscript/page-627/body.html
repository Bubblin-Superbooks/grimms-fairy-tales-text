<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Just let twelve spinning-wheels be brought into the ante-chamber, and they will go to them and be pleased with them, and that is what no man would do.&rsquo; The king liked the advice, and had the spinning-wheels placed in the ante-chamber.</p><p>But the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them, and disclosed the project. So when they were alone the king&rsquo;s daughter said to her eleven girls: &lsquo;Show some constraint, and do not look round at the spinning-wheels.&rsquo; And next morning when the king had his twelve huntsmen summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once looked at the spinning-wheels. Then the king again said to the lion: &lsquo;You have deceived me, they are men, for they have not looked at the spinning-wheels.&rsquo; The lion replied: &lsquo;They have restrained themselves.&rsquo; The king, however, would no longer believe the lion.</p></div> </div>
