<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>After Hans had had her some time, he said: &lsquo;Wife, I am going out to work and earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we may have some bread.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.&rsquo; After Hans had gone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field with her. When she came to the field she said to herself: &lsquo;What shall I do; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.&rsquo; Then she drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once more said: &lsquo;What shall I do? Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first? I will sleep first.&rsquo; Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep. Hans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said he: &lsquo;What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not even come home to eat.</p></div> </div>
