<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Long before you or I were born, there reigned, in a country a great way off, a king who had three sons. This king once fell very ill&mdash;so ill that nobody thought he could live. His sons were very much grieved at their father&rsquo;s sickness; and as they were walking together very mournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and asked what was the matter. They told him that their father was very ill, and that they were afraid nothing could save him. &lsquo;I know what would,&rsquo; said the little old man; &lsquo;it is the Water of Life. If he could have a draught of it he would be well again; but it is very hard to get.&rsquo; Then the eldest son said, &lsquo;I will soon find it&rsquo;: and he went to the sick king, and begged that he might go in search of the Water of Life, as it was the only thing that could save him. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the king.</p></div> </div>
