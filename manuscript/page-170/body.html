HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS</p><p>&lsquo;The nuts are quite ripe now,&rsquo; said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet, &lsquo;suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can, before the squirrel takes them all away.&rsquo; &lsquo;With all my heart,&rsquo; said Partlet, &lsquo;let us go and make a holiday of it together.&rsquo;</p><p>So they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they stayed there till the evening. Now, whether it was that they had eaten so many nuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and would not, I do not know: however, they took it into their heads that it did not become them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to build a little carriage of nutshells: and when it was finished, Partlet jumped into it and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her home.</p></div> </div>
