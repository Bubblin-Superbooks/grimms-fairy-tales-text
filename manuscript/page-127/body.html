And on each side of her were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the greatest as large as the highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no larger than a small rushlight. &lsquo;Wife,&rsquo; said the fisherman, as he looked at all this greatness, &lsquo;are you pope?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I am pope.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, wife,&rsquo; replied he, &lsquo;it is a grand thing to be pope; and now you must be easy, for you can be nothing greater.</p></div> </div>
