He thought to himself, &lsquo;If the giant sees me going in, my life will not be worth much.&rsquo; However, after a while he summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw him, he called out, &lsquo;It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had anything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper.&rsquo; &lsquo;I would rather you let that alone,&rsquo; said the man, &lsquo;for I do not willingly give myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to satisfy your hunger.</p></div> </div>
