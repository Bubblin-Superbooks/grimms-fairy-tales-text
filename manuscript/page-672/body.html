<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Now the old woman was a witch, and said to the young lady, &lsquo;There is a young man coming out of the wood who carries a wonderful prize; we must get it away from him, my dear child, for it is more fit for us than for him. He has a bird&rsquo;s heart that brings a piece of gold under his pillow every morning.&rsquo; Meantime the huntsman came nearer and looked at the lady, and said to himself, &lsquo;I have been travelling so long that I should like to go into this castle and rest myself, for I have money enough to pay for anything I want&rsquo;; but the real reason was, that he wanted to see more of the beautiful lady. Then he went into the house, and was welcomed kindly; and it was not long before he was so much in love that he thought of nothing else but looking at the lady&rsquo;s eyes, and doing everything that she wished.</p></div> </div>
