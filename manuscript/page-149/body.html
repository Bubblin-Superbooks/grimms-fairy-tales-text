Let me go out today, and you look after the house by yourself.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; answered the mouse, &lsquo;by all means go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me. I should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.&rsquo; All this, however, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to be godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off.</p></div> </div>
