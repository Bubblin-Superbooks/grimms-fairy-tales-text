<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The king came in the morning, and, finding all he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so he married the miller&rsquo;s daughter, and she really became queen.</p><p>At the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the dwarf, and what she had said. But one day he came into her room, where she was sitting playing with her baby, and put her in mind of it. Then she grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give him all the wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in vain; till at last her tears softened him, and he said, &lsquo;I will give you three days&rsquo; grace, and if during that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your child.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
