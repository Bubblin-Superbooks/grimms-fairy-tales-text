<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the forest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his body with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: &lsquo;I have eaten a whole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger as I? My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to die of hunger.&rsquo;</p><p>At this Dummling was glad, and said: &lsquo;Get up and come with me; you shall eat yourself full.&rsquo; He led him to the king&rsquo;s palace where all the flour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a huge mountain of bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood before it, began to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished.</p></div> </div>
