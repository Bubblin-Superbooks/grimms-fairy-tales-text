Don&rsquo;t bring me any more hay!&rsquo;</p><p>The maid happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing someone speak, but seeing nobody, and yet being quite sure it was the same voice that she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she fell off her stool, and overset the milk-pail. As soon as she could pick herself up out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could to her master the parson, and said, &lsquo;Sir, sir, the cow is talking!&rsquo; But the parson said, &lsquo;Woman, thou art surely mad!&rsquo; However, he went with her into the cow-house, to try and see what was the matter.</p></div> </div>
