But no sooner was the princess released from the spell, than she seized the prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffin&rsquo;s back, and went off carrying the prince away with her.</p><p>Thus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she took heart and said, &lsquo;As far as the wind blows, and so long as the cock crows, I will journey on, till I find him once again.&rsquo; She went on for a long, long way, till at length she came to the castle whither the princess had carried the prince; and there was a feast got ready, and she heard that the wedding was about to be held.</p></div> </div>
