Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had said &lsquo;good morning&rsquo; to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the grandmother, &lsquo;we will shut the door, that he may not come in.&rsquo; Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried: &lsquo;Open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you some cakes.</p></div> </div>
