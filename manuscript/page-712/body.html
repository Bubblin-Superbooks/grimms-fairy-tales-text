<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she only made sport of them.</p><p>Once upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all her suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their rank&mdash;kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons, and knights. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she had something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: &lsquo;He&rsquo;s as round as a tub,&rsquo; said she. The next was too tall: &lsquo;What a maypole!&rsquo; said she. The next was too short: &lsquo;What a dumpling!&rsquo; said she. The fourth was too pale, and she called him &lsquo;Wallface.</p></div> </div>
