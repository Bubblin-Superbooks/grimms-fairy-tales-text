<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Have you any inclination to go with me?&rsquo; The giant looked contemptuously at the tailor, and said: &lsquo;You ragamuffin! You miserable creature!&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Oh, indeed?&rsquo; answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and showed the giant the girdle, &lsquo;there may you read what kind of a man I am!&rsquo; The giant read: &lsquo;Seven at one stroke,&rsquo; and thought that they had been men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect for the tiny fellow. Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took a stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out of it. &lsquo;Do that likewise,&rsquo; said the giant, &lsquo;if you have strength.&rsquo; &lsquo;Is that all?&rsquo; said the tailor, &lsquo;that is child&rsquo;s play with us!&rsquo; and put his hand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until the liquid ran out of it.</p></div> </div>
