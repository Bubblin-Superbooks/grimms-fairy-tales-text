<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The fowls began to turn brown, and were nearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called out to her master: &lsquo;If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten the moment they are at their juiciest.&rsquo; The master said: &lsquo;I will run myself, and fetch the guest.&rsquo; When the master had turned his back, Gretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: &lsquo;Standing so long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows when they will come? Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a drink.&rsquo; She ran down, set a jug, said: &lsquo;God bless it for you, Gretel,&rsquo; and took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should not be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.</p></div> </div>
