<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&lsquo;Poor bear,&rsquo; said the mother, &lsquo;lie down by the fire, only take care that you do not burn your coat.&rsquo; Then she cried: &lsquo;Snow-white, Rose-red, come out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.&rsquo; So they both came out, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid of him. The bear said: &lsquo;Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a little&rsquo;; so they brought the broom and swept the bear&rsquo;s hide clean; and he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and comfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played tricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands, put their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a hazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed.</p></div> </div>
