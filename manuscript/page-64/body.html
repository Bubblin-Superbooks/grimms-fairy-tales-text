The ass placed himself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the window; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog&rsquo;s shoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat&rsquo;s head. When all was ready a signal was given, and they began their music.</p></div> </div>
