He was old, however, and had a long white beard. &lsquo;You wretch,&rsquo; cried he, &lsquo;you shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for you shall die.&rsquo; &lsquo;Not so fast,&rsquo; replied the youth. &lsquo;If I am to die, I shall have to have a say in it.&rsquo; &lsquo;I will soon seize you,&rsquo; said the fiend. &lsquo;Softly, softly, do not talk so big. I am as strong as you are, and perhaps even stronger.&rsquo; &lsquo;We shall see,&rsquo; said the old man. &lsquo;If you are stronger, I will let you go&mdash;come, we will try.&rsquo; Then he led him by dark passages to a smith&rsquo;s forge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground. &lsquo;I can do better than that,&rsquo; said the youth, and went to the other anvil.
