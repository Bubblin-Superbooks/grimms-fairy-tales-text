Cat-skin was brought again before the king, but she still told him that she was only fit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head.</p><p>But when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third time, it happened just the same as before. &lsquo;You must be a witch, Cat-skin,&rsquo; said the cook; &lsquo;for you always put something into your soup, so that it pleases the king better than mine.&rsquo; However, he let her go up as before.</p></div> </div>
