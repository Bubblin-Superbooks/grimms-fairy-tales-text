Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: &lsquo;Get up, lazy thing, fetch some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.&rsquo; Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was forced to do what the wicked witch commanded.</p></div> </div>
