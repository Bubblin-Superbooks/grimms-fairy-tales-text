You think yourself a promised bride, and that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with death that you will keep your marriage feast. Look, do you see that large cauldron of water which I am obliged to keep on the fire! As soon as they have you in their power they will kill you without mercy, and cook and eat you, for they are eaters of men. If I did not take pity on you and save you, you would be lost.&rsquo;</p><p>Thereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid her from view. &lsquo;Keep as still as a mouse,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;do not move or speak, or it will be all over with you.</p></div> </div>
