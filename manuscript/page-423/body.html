Long before the end of the hour the work was quite done, and all flew out again at the windows.</p><p>Then Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought that now she should go to the ball. But the mother said, &lsquo;No, no! you slut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go.&rsquo; And when Ashputtel begged very hard to go, she said, &lsquo;If you can in one hour&rsquo;s time pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes, you shall go too.&rsquo; And thus she thought she should at least get rid of her. So she shook two dishes of peas into the ashes.</p></div> </div>
