Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and he did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. The king grew angry, and said: &lsquo;That is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell his name.&rsquo; He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple, should go away again they should pursue him, and if he would not come back willingly, they were to cut him down and stab him.</p><p>On the third day, he received from Iron Hans a suit of black armour and a black horse, and again he caught the apple. But when he was riding off with it, the king&rsquo;s attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near him that he wounded the youth&rsquo;s leg with the point of his sword.</p></div> </div>
