Lina saw this and said, &lsquo;Listen, old Sanna, why are you fetching so much water?&rsquo; &lsquo;If you will never repeat it to anyone, I will tell you why.&rsquo; So Lina said, no, she would never repeat it to anyone, and then the cook said: &lsquo;Early tomorrow morning, when the forester is out hunting, I will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the kettle, I will throw in Fundevogel, and will boil him in it.&rsquo;</p><p>Early next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and when he was gone the children were still in bed. Then Lina said to Fundevogel: &lsquo;If you will never leave me, I too will never leave you.</p></div> </div>
