<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The king said to his daughter: &lsquo;I will proclaim a great feast that shall last for three days, and you shall throw a golden apple. Perhaps the unknown man will show himself.&rsquo; When the feast was announced, the youth went out to the forest, and called Iron Hans. &lsquo;What do you desire?&rsquo; asked he. &lsquo;That I may catch the king&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s golden apple.&rsquo; &lsquo;It is as safe as if you had it already,&rsquo; said Iron Hans. &lsquo;You shall likewise have a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited chestnut-horse.&rsquo; When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took his place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one. The king&rsquo;s daughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none of them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away.</p></div> </div>
