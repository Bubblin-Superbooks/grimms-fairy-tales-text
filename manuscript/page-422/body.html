And when she kept on begging, she said at last, to get rid of her, &lsquo;I will throw this dishful of peas into the ash-heap, and if in two hours&rsquo; time you have picked them all out, you shall go to the feast too.&rsquo;</p><p>Then she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden ran out at the back door into the garden, and cried out:</p><p>Then first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window; next came two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven, chirping and fluttering in: and they flew down into the ashes.</p></div> </div>
