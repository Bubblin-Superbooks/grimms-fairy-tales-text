The robber took a light and began looking for it, but he could not find it. &lsquo;Have you looked behind the large cask?&rsquo; said one of the others. But the old woman called out, &lsquo;Come and eat your suppers, and let the thing be till tomorrow; the finger won&rsquo;t run away.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;The old woman is right,&rsquo; said the robbers, and they ceased looking for the finger and sat down.</p></div> </div>
