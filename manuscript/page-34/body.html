As he went lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight, trotting gaily along on a capital horse. &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Hans aloud, &lsquo;what a fine thing it is to ride on horseback! There he sits as easy and happy as if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no stones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows how.&rsquo; Hans did not speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, &lsquo;Well, friend, why do you go on foot then?&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I have this load to carry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can&rsquo;t hold up my head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.&rsquo; &lsquo;What do you say of making an exchange?&rsquo; said the horseman.</p></div> </div>
