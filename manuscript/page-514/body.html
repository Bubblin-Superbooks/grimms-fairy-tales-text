<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When he came back the father again asked: &lsquo;My son, what have you learnt?&rsquo; He answered: &lsquo;Father, I have learnt what the birds say.&rsquo; Then the father fell into a rage and said: &lsquo;Oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and learnt nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes? I will send you to a third master, but if you learn nothing this time also, I will no longer be your father.&rsquo; The youth remained a whole year with the third master also, and when he came home again, and his father inquired: &lsquo;My son, what have you learnt?&rsquo; he answered: &lsquo;Dear father, I have this year learnt what the frogs croak.&rsquo; Then the father fell into the most furious anger, sprang up, called his people thither, and said: &lsquo;This man is no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him out into the forest, and kill him.</p></div> </div>
