<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will not have her named.&rsquo; Then the huntsman arose and said: &lsquo;Gracious lord father she is alive still, and I am her son, and I was not carried away by wild beasts, but by that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her arms when she was asleep, and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a chicken.&rsquo; Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar, and said: &lsquo;That is the wretch!&rsquo; and caused live coals to be brought, and these the dog was compelled to devour before the sight of all, until flames burst forth from its throat. On this the huntsman asked the king if he would like to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into the form of the cook, in the which he stood immediately, with his white apron, and his knife by his side.</p></div> </div>
