After he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard of a royal palace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and fell asleep. Whilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all sides, and read on his girdle: &lsquo;Seven at one stroke.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;what does the great warrior want here in the midst of peace? He must be a mighty lord.&rsquo; They went and announced him to the king, and gave it as their opinion that if war should break out, this would be a weighty and useful man who ought on no account to be allowed to depart. The counsel pleased the king, and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer him military service when he awoke.</p></div> </div>
