<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was now three mornings since they had left their father&rsquo;s house. They began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar. &lsquo;We will set to work on that,&rsquo; said Hansel, &lsquo;and have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat some of the window, it will taste sweet.</p></div> </div>
