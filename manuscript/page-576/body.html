She got out of her carriage and went to him; she called him and shook him, but it was all in vain, he still continued sleeping.</p><p>The next day at noon, the old woman came to him again with food and drink which he at first refused. At last, overcome by her persistent entreaties that he would take something, he lifted the glass and drank again.</p></div> </div>
