<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&rsquo; Fundevogel said: &lsquo;Neither now, nor ever will I leave you.&rsquo; Then said Lina: &lsquo;Then will I tell you. Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water into the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said that if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early tomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle full of water, throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up quickly, dress ourselves, and go away together.&rsquo;</p><p>The two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly, and went away. When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the bedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it. But when she came in, and went to the beds, both the children were gone.</p></div> </div>
