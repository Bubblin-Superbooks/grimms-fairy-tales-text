However, I&rsquo;ll try and set up a trade in pots and pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.&rsquo; &lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; sighed she, &lsquo;if any of my father&rsquo;s court should pass by and see me standing in the market, how they will laugh at me!&rsquo;</p><p>But her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she did not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many people, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid their money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on this as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of ware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market;</p></div> </div>
