At last a prince came and called at the dwarfs&rsquo; house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written in golden letters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them to let him take her away; but they said, &lsquo;We will not part with her for all the gold in the world.&rsquo; At last, however, they had pity on him, and gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home with him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop awoke, and said, &lsquo;Where am I?&rsquo; And the prince said, &lsquo;Thou art quite safe with me.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
