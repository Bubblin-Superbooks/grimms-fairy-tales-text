<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Long, long ago, some two thousand years or so, there lived a rich man with a good and beautiful wife. They loved each other dearly, but sorrowed much that they had no children. So greatly did they desire to have one, that the wife prayed for it day and night, but still they remained childless.</p><p>In front of the house there was a court, in which grew a juniper-tree. One winter&rsquo;s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples, and as she was peeling them, she cut her finger, and the blood fell on the snow. &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; sighed the woman heavily, &lsquo;if I had but a child, as red as blood and as white as snow,&rsquo; and as she spoke the words, her heart grew light within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted.</p></div> </div>
