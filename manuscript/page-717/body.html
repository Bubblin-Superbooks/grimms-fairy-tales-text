When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the fiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus they lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the cottage, the man said, &lsquo;Wife, we can&rsquo;t go on thus, spending money and earning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.&rsquo; Then he went out and cut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made her fingers very sore. &lsquo;I see this work won&rsquo;t do,&rsquo; said he: &lsquo;try and spin; perhaps you will do that better.&rsquo; So she sat down and tried to spin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran.</p></div> </div>
