Then a soft voice cried from the parlour:</p><p>The children answered:</p><p>and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: &lsquo;Oh, you dear children, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No harm shall happen to you.&rsquo; She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house.</p></div> </div>
