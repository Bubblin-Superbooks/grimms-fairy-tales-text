Once in summer when he was working alone in the garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air might cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so that the rays fell into the bedroom of the king&rsquo;s daughter, and up she sprang to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy, and cried to him: &lsquo;Boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.&rsquo; He put his cap on with all haste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together. When he was ascending the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said: &lsquo;How can you take the king&rsquo;s daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go quickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; replied the boy, &lsquo;the wild ones have more scent, and will please her better.</p></div> </div>
