<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The unicorn soon came towards him, and rushed directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its horn without more ado. &lsquo;Softly, softly; it can&rsquo;t be done as quickly as that,&rsquo; said he, and stood still and waited until the animal was quite close, and then sprang nimbly behind the tree. The unicorn ran against the tree with all its strength, and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk that it had not the strength enough to draw it out again, and thus it was caught. &lsquo;Now, I have got the bird,&rsquo; said the tailor, and came out from behind the tree and put the rope round its neck, and then with his axe he hewed the horn out of the tree, and when all was ready he led the beast away and took it to the king.</p></div> </div>
