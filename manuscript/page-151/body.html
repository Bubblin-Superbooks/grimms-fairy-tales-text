She said to the mouse: &lsquo;You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for a day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.&rsquo; The good mouse consented, but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured half the pot of fat. &lsquo;Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself,&rsquo; said she, and was quite satisfied with her day&rsquo;s work. When she went home the mouse inquired: &lsquo;And what was the child christened?&rsquo; &lsquo;Half-done,&rsquo; answered the cat. &lsquo;Half-done! What are you saying? I never heard the name in my life, I&rsquo;ll wager anything it is not in the calendar!&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
