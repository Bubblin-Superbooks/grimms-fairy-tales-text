The carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the spot. &lsquo;Unlucky wretch that I am!&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Not wretch enough yet!&rsquo; said the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him too. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his third horse as he done the other two. &lsquo;Alas! miserable wretch that I am!&rsquo; cried he. &lsquo;Not wretch enough yet!&rsquo; answered the sparrow as she flew away; &lsquo;now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.</p></div> </div>
