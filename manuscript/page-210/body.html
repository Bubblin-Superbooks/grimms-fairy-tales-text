<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The giant, after he had dragged the heavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried: &lsquo;Hark you, I shall have to let the tree fall!&rsquo; The tailor sprang nimbly down, seized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and said to the giant: &lsquo;You are such a great fellow, and yet cannot even carry the tree!&rsquo;</p><p>They went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it down, gave it into the tailor&rsquo;s hand, and bade him eat. But the little tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go, it sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it.</p></div> </div>
