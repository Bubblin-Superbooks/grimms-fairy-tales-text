<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling noise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener&rsquo;s son jumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm; only it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away. The golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the council was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than all the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, &lsquo;One feather is of no use to me, I must have the whole bird.&rsquo;</p><p>Then the gardener&rsquo;s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden bird very easily;</p></div> </div>
