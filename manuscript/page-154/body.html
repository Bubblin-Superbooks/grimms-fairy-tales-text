You are a true friend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First top off, then half-done, then&mdash;&rsquo; &lsquo;Will you hold your tongue,&rsquo; cried the cat, &lsquo;one word more, and I will eat you too.&rsquo; &lsquo;All-gone&rsquo; was already on the poor mouse&rsquo;s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang on her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of the world.</p></div> </div>
