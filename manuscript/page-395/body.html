Then the huntsman spoke further and said: &lsquo;Father, will you see the maiden who brought me up so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me, but did not do it, though her own life depended on it?&rsquo; The king replied: &lsquo;Yes, I would like to see her.&rsquo; The son said: &lsquo;Most gracious father, I will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower,&rsquo; and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table, and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it. Then the son said: &lsquo;Now will I show her to you in her own form,&rsquo; and wished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there looking so beautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.</p></div> </div>
