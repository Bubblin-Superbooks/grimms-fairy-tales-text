<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all seven to her and said: &lsquo;Dear children, I have to go into the forest, be on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you all&mdash;skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often disguises himself, but you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.&rsquo; The kids said: &lsquo;Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go away without any anxiety.&rsquo; Then the old one bleated, and went on her way with an easy mind.</p></div> </div>
