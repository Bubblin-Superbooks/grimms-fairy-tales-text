<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children. Every morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to bestow on her a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to her and said: &lsquo;Be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of wishing, so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have.&rsquo; Then she went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time was come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness.</p><p>Every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild beasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. It happened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in her arms and she fell asleep.</p></div> </div>
