<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called Dummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion.</p><p>It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood, and before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a bottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.</p><p>When he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day, and said: &lsquo;Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket, and let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.&rsquo; But the clever son answered: &lsquo;If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have none for myself; be off with you,&rsquo; and he left the little man standing and went on.</p></div> </div>
