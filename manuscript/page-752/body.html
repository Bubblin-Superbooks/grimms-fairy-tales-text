I will take care and stand behind the door.&rsquo; And the cook said, &lsquo;Yes, you may go, but be back again in half an hour&rsquo;s time, to rake out the ashes.&rsquo; Then she took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the fur skin, and washed the soot from off her face and hands, so that her beauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened her nutshell, and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun, and so went to the feast. Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew her, and they thought she could be no less than a king&rsquo;s daughter. But the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart, &lsquo;I never saw any one half so beautiful.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
