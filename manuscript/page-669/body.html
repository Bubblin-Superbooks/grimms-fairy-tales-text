<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As a merry young huntsman was once going briskly along through a wood, there came up a little old woman, and said to him, &lsquo;Good day, good day; you seem merry enough, but I am hungry and thirsty; do pray give me something to eat.&rsquo; The huntsman took pity on her, and put his hand in his pocket and gave her what he had. Then he wanted to go his way; but she took hold of him, and said, &lsquo;Listen, my friend, to what I am going to tell you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way, and after a little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds sitting on a cloak. Shoot into the midst of them, and one will fall down dead: the cloak will fall too; take it, it is a wishing-cloak, and when you wear it you will find yourself at any place where you may wish to be.</p></div> </div>
