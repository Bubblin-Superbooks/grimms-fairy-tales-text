Then he threw his cloak around him, and passed through the castle hall, and placed himself by the side of the queen, where no one saw him. But when anything to eat was put upon her plate, he took it away and ate it himself; and when a glass of wine was handed to her, he took it and drank it; and thus, though they kept on giving her meat and drink, her plate and cup were always empty.</p><p>Upon this, fear and remorse came over her, and she went into her chamber alone, and sat there weeping; and he followed her there. &lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; said she to herself, &lsquo;was I not once set free? Why then does this enchantment still seem to bind me?&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
