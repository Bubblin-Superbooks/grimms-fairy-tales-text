<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called: &lsquo;Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought something back with her for each of you.&rsquo; But the little kids knew that it was the wolf, by the rough voice. &lsquo;We will not open the door,&rsquo; cried they, &lsquo;you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but your voice is rough; you are the wolf!&rsquo; Then the wolf went away to a shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made his voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the house, and called: &lsquo;Open the door, dear children, your mother is here and has brought something back with her for each of you.</p></div> </div>
