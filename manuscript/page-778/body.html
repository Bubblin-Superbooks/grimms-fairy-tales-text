<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Come, take these two wicked girls, they are tender morsels for you, fat as young quails; for mercy&rsquo;s sake eat them!&rsquo; The bear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature a single blow with his paw, and he did not move again.</p><p>The girls had run away, but the bear called to them: &lsquo;Snow-white and Rose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.&rsquo; Then they recognized his voice and waited, and when he came up to them suddenly his bearskin fell off, and he stood there a handsome man, clothed all in gold. &lsquo;I am a king&rsquo;s son,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and I was bewitched by that wicked dwarf, who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run about the forest as a savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now he has got his well-deserved punishment.</p></div> </div>
