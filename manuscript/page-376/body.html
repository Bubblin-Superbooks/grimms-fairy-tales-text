Let me lace them up with one of my nice new laces.&rsquo; Snowdrop did not dream of any mischief; so she stood before the old woman; but she set to work so nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight, that Snowdrop&rsquo;s breath was stopped, and she fell down as if she were dead. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s an end to all thy beauty,&rsquo; said the spiteful queen, and went away home.</p><p>In the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how grieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the ground, as if she was quite dead.</p></div> </div>
