<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little peasant said: &lsquo;First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth is something bad.&rsquo; So they ate, and after that they bargained how much the miller was to give for the fifth prophecy, until they agreed on three hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched the raven&rsquo;s head till he croaked loudly. The miller asked: &lsquo;What did he say?&rsquo; The peasant replied: &lsquo;He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in the closet on the porch.&rsquo; The miller said: &lsquo;The Devil must go out,&rsquo; and opened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys, and the peasant unlocked the closet. The parson ran out as fast as he could, and the miller said: &lsquo;It was true; I saw the black rascal with my own eyes.&rsquo; The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with the three hundred talers.</p></div> </div>
