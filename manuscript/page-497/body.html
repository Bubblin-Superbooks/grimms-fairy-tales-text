<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I have a brother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world knows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me.&rsquo;</p><p>The king then took pity on him, and said, &lsquo;You shall be poor no longer. I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your brother.&rsquo; Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so rich that his brother&rsquo;s fortune could not at all be compared with his.</p><p>When the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the gardener so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he could contrive to get the same good fortune for himself. However, he determined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together a rich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must have a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so much for only a turnip, what must his present be worth?</p></div> </div>
