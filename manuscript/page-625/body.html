It came to pass that one evening he said to the king: &lsquo;You think you have twelve huntsmen?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the king, &lsquo;they are twelve huntsmen.&rsquo; The lion continued: &lsquo;You are mistaken, they are twelve girls.&rsquo; The king said: &lsquo;That cannot be true! How will you prove that to me?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, just let some peas be strewn in the ante-chamber,&rsquo; answered the lion, &lsquo;and then you will soon see. Men have a firm step, and when they walk over peas none of them stir, but girls trip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about.&rsquo; The king was well pleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn.</p></div> </div>
