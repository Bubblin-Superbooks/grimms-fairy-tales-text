They tore up trees in their sore need, and defended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man like myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.&rsquo; &lsquo;But are you not wounded?&rsquo; asked the horsemen. &lsquo;You need not concern yourself about that,&rsquo; answered the tailor, &lsquo;they have not bent one hair of mine.</p></div> </div>
