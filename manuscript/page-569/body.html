When he was led forth to die, he begged a last favour of the king. &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; asked the king. &lsquo;That I may smoke one more pipe on my way.&rsquo; &lsquo;You may smoke three,&rsquo; answered the king, &lsquo;but do not imagine that I will spare your life.&rsquo; Then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended, the manikin was there with a small cudgel in his hand, and said: &lsquo;What does my lord command?&rsquo; &lsquo;Strike down to earth that false judge there, and his constable, and spare not the king who has treated me so ill.</p></div> </div>
