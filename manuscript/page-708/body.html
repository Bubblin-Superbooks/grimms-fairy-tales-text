The youth drew out the axe and let him go. The old man led him back into the castle, and in a cellar showed him three chests full of gold. &lsquo;Of these,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;one part is for the poor, the other for the king, the third yours.&rsquo; In the meantime it struck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so that the youth stood in darkness. &lsquo;I shall still be able to find my way out,&rsquo; said he, and felt about, found the way into the room, and slept there by his fire.</p></div> </div>
