What is it that you will not do?&rsquo; The peasant said: &lsquo;They want to make me mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.&rsquo; The shepherd said: &lsquo;If nothing more than that is needful in order to be mayor, I would get into the barrel at once.&rsquo; The peasant said: &lsquo;If you will get in, you will be mayor.&rsquo; The shepherd was willing, and got in, and the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd&rsquo;s flock for himself, and drove it away. The parson went to the crowd, and declared that the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the barrel towards the water. When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd cried: &lsquo;I am quite willing to be mayor.</p></div> </div>
