<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for him three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came into the man&rsquo;s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer; so he went to his master, and said, &lsquo;I have worked hard for you a long time, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my trouble.&rsquo; The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very simple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year&rsquo;s service a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to have, and said to himself, &lsquo;Why should I work hard, and live here on bad fare any longer? I can now travel into the wide world, and make myself merry.&rsquo; With that he put his money into his purse, and set out, roaming over hill and valley.</p></div> </div>
