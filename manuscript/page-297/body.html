Speak low, that you may not awaken anybody.&rsquo; But Tom seemed as if he did not understand them, and bawled out again, &lsquo;How much will you have? Shall I throw it all out?&rsquo; Now the cook lay in the next room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and listened. Meantime the thieves were frightened, and ran off a little way; but at last they plucked up their hearts, and said, &lsquo;The little urchin is only trying to make fools of us.</p></div> </div>
