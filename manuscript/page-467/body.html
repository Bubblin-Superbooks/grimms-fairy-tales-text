<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over the fire chatting together, he said to her, &lsquo;I should like to sit up and watch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for me.&rsquo; The wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning, and hid themselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up there, and watched what would happen.</p><p>As soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and they sat themselves upon the shoemaker&rsquo;s bench, took up all the work that was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching and rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all wonder, and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went, till the job was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table. This was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as lightning.</p></div> </div>
