Then he fell on his knees before the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but she laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she went her way.</p><p>He prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. &lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;what will become of me?&rsquo; He could not go back to his own home, so he went to a strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go, but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.</p></div> </div>
