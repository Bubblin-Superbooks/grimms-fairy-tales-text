Then she dressed herself up as a peasant&rsquo;s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs&rsquo; cottage, and knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and said, &lsquo;I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.&rsquo; &lsquo;Do as you please,&rsquo; said the old woman, &lsquo;but at any rate take this pretty apple; I will give it you.&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Snowdrop, &lsquo;I dare not take it.&rsquo; &lsquo;You silly girl!&rsquo; answered the other, &lsquo;what are you afraid of? Do you think it is poisoned? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the other.&rsquo; Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the other side was poisoned.</p></div> </div>
