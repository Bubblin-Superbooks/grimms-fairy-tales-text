<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried: &lsquo;You have invited a fine guest!&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, Gretel? What do you mean by that?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;he has taken the chickens which I was just going to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!&rsquo; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a nice trick!&rsquo; said her master, and lamented the fine chickens. &lsquo;If he had but left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.&rsquo; He called to him to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him with the knife still in his hand, crying: &lsquo;Just one, just one,&rsquo; meaning that the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both. The guest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of his ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take them both with him.</p></div> </div>
