When he heard what Dummling wanted, he said: &lsquo;Since you have given me to eat and to drink, I will give you the ship; and I do all this because you once were kind to me.&rsquo; Then he gave him the ship which could sail on land and water, and when the king saw that, he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter. The wedding was celebrated, and after the king&rsquo;s death, Dummling inherited his kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.</p></div> </div>
