And six mice built a little hearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed themselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them. On the way they met the fox. &lsquo;Where are you going, Chanticleer?&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;To bury my Partlet,&rsquo; said the other. &lsquo;May I go with you?&rsquo; said the fox. &lsquo;Yes; but you must get up behind, or my horses will not be able to draw you.&rsquo; Then the fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the bear, the goat, and all the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon the hearse.</p></div> </div>
