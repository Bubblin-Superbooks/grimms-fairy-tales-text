<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> said the moon, &lsquo;I cannot help thee but I will give thee an egg&mdash;break it when need comes.&rsquo;</p><p>Then she thanked the moon, and went on till the night-wind blew; and she raised up her voice to it, and said, &lsquo;Thou blowest through every tree and under every leaf&mdash;hast thou not seen my white dove?&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the night-wind, &lsquo;but I will ask three other winds; perhaps they have seen it.&rsquo; Then the east wind and the west wind came, and said they too had not seen it, but the south wind said, &lsquo;I have seen the white dove&mdash;he has fled to the Red Sea, and is changed once more into a lion, for the seven years are passed away, and there he is fighting with a dragon; and the dragon is an enchanted princess, who seeks to separate him from you.&rsquo; Then the night-wind said, &lsquo;I will give thee counsel.</p></div> </div>
