So he set out and followed the same road which his brother had done, and met with the same elf, who stopped him at the same spot in the mountains, saying, as before, &lsquo;Prince, prince, whither so fast?&rsquo; &lsquo;Mind your own affairs, busybody!&rsquo; said the prince scornfully, and rode on.</p></div> </div>
