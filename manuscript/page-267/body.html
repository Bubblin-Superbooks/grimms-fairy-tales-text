<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&lsquo;What have you got in your apron?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you surely must know it,&rsquo; replied Little Red-Cap.</p><p>The wolf thought to himself: &lsquo;What a tender young creature! what a nice plump mouthful&mdash;she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must act craftily, so as to catch both.&rsquo; So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: &lsquo;See, Little Red-Cap, how pretty the flowers are about here&mdash;why do you not look round? I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing;</p></div> </div>
