Now will I pronounce thy sentence. You shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck, and shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your throat.&rsquo; And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed into a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks were ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the flames broke forth from his throat. The king&rsquo;s son remained there a short while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she were still alive. At length he said to the maiden: &lsquo;I will go home to my own country; if you will go with me, I will provide for you.</p></div> </div>
