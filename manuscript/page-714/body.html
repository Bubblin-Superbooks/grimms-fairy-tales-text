<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said, &lsquo;Let him come in.&rsquo; So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when he had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the king said, &lsquo;You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for your wife.&rsquo; The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, &lsquo;I have sworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.&rsquo; So words and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married to the fiddler. When this was over the king said, &lsquo;Now get ready to go&mdash;you must not stay here&mdash;you must travel on with your husband.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
