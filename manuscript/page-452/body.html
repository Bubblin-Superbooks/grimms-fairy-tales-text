<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The youngest, who was in the clock-case, was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had satisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep. Soon afterwards the old goat came home again from the forest. Ah! what a sight she saw there! The house-door stood wide open. The table, chairs, and benches were thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts and pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her children, but they were nowhere to be found. She called them one after another by name, but no one answered. At last, when she came to the youngest, a soft voice cried: &lsquo;Dear mother, I am in the clock-case.&rsquo; She took the kid out, and it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.</p></div> </div>
