It is the bird&rsquo;s heart that will bring you this good luck.&rsquo;</p><p>The huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, &lsquo;If all this does happen, it will be a fine thing for me.&rsquo; When he had gone a hundred steps or so, he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over him, and looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their bills and feet; screaming, fighting, and tugging at each other as if each wished to have it himself. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the huntsman, &lsquo;this is wonderful; this happens just as the old woman said&rsquo;; then he shot into the midst of them so that their feathers flew all about. Off went the flock chattering away; but one fell down dead, and the cloak with it.</p></div> </div>
