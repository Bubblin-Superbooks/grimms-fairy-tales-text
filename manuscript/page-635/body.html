The little black dwarf soon came, and walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any way to get into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over it. At last the boy said to him. &lsquo;Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or what do you want?&rsquo; Now Heinel had found a friend in a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do; for this fairy knew what good luck was in store for him. &lsquo;Have you brought me what you said you would?&rsquo; said the dwarf to the merchant.</p></div> </div>
