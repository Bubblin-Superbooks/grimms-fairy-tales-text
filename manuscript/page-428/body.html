<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When night came she wanted to go home; and the king&rsquo;s son followed here as before, that he might see into what house she went: but she sprang away from him all at once into the garden behind her father&rsquo;s house. In this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and Ashputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without being seen. Then the king&rsquo;s son lost sight of her, and could not find out where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said to him, &lsquo;The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I think she must have sprung into the pear-tree.&rsquo; The father thought to himself, &lsquo;Can it be Ashputtel?&rsquo; So he had an axe brought; and they cut down the tree, but found no one upon it.</p></div> </div>
