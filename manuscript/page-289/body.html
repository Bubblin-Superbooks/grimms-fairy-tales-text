<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A poor woodman sat in his cottage one night, smoking his pipe by the fireside, while his wife sat by his side spinning. &lsquo;How lonely it is, wife,&rsquo; said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, &lsquo;for you and me to sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse us while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!&rsquo; &lsquo;What you say is very true,&rsquo; said the wife, sighing, and turning round her wheel; &lsquo;how happy should I be if I had but one child! If it were ever so small&mdash;nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb&mdash;I should be very happy, and love it dearly.&rsquo; Now&mdash;odd as you may think it&mdash;it came to pass that this good woman&rsquo;s wish was fulfilled, just in the very way she had wished it; for, not long afterwards, she had a little boy, who was quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb.</p></div> </div>
