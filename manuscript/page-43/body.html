<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Poor Hans was sadly frightened. &lsquo;Good man,&rsquo; cried he, &lsquo;pray get me out of this scrape. I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or born; but he may have been the squire&rsquo;s for aught I can tell: you know this country better than I do, take my pig and give me the goose.&rsquo; &lsquo;I ought to have something into the bargain,&rsquo; said the countryman; &lsquo;give a fat goose for a pig, indeed! &lsquo;Tis not everyone would do so much for you as that. However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.&rsquo; Then he took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path; while Hans went on the way homewards free from care. &lsquo;After all,&rsquo; thought he, &lsquo;that chap is pretty well taken in. I don&rsquo;t care whose pig it is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me. I have much the best of the bargain.</p></div> </div>
