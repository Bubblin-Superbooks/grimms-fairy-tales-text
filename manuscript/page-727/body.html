The next day he again went and asked for his ball; the wild man said: &lsquo;Open my door,&rsquo; but the boy would not. On the third day the king had ridden out hunting, and the boy went once more and said: &lsquo;I cannot open the door even if I wished, for I have not the key.&rsquo; Then the wild man said: &lsquo;It lies under your mother&rsquo;s pillow, you can get it there.&rsquo; The boy, who wanted to have his ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key. The door opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers. When it was open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried away.</p></div> </div>
