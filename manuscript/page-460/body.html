<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The first tablet said: &lsquo;In the wood, under the moss, lie the thousand pearls belonging to the king&rsquo;s daughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing by set of sun, he who seeks them will be turned into marble.&rsquo;</p><p>The eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day: but the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he was turned into stone as the tablet had foretold.</p><p>The next day the second brother undertook the task; but he succeeded no better than the first; for he could only find the second hundred of the pearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone.</p></div> </div>
