<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A shepherd&rsquo;s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood. On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, &lsquo;Why are you so sad, my friend?&rsquo; &lsquo;Because,&rsquo; said the dog, &lsquo;I am very very hungry, and have nothing to eat.&rsquo; &lsquo;If that be all,&rsquo; answered the sparrow, &lsquo;come with me into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.&rsquo; So on they went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher&rsquo;s shop, the sparrow said to the dog, &lsquo;Stand there a little while till I peck you down a piece of meat.</p></div> </div>
