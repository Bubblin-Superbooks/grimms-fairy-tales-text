<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together. &lsquo;But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer from hunger,&rsquo; said the cat; &lsquo;and you, little mouse, cannot venture everywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.&rsquo; The good advice was followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where to put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: &lsquo;I know no place where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one dares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar, and not touch it until we are really in need of it.</p></div> </div>
