<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &lsquo;Well, wife,&rsquo; said the fisherman, &lsquo;are you king?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I am king.&rsquo; And when he had looked at her for a long time, he said, &lsquo;Ah, wife! what a fine thing it is to be king! Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long as we live.&rsquo; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how that may be,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;never is a long time. I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I think I should like to be emperor.&rsquo; &lsquo;Alas, wife! why should you wish to be emperor?&rsquo; said the fisherman. &lsquo;Husband,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;go to the fish! I say I will be emperor.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah, wife!&rsquo; replied the fisherman, &lsquo;the fish cannot make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for such a thing.&rsquo; &lsquo;I am king,&rsquo; said Ilsabill, &lsquo;and you are my slave; so go at once!&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
