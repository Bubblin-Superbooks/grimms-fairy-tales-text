<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The youngest son fell to the bottom of the river&rsquo;s bed: luckily it was nearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep that he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once more, and scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would have befallen him: &lsquo;Yet,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I cannot leave you here, so lay hold of my tail and hold fast.&rsquo; Then he pulled him out of the river, and said to him, as he got upon the bank, &lsquo;Your brothers have set watch to kill you, if they find you in the kingdom.&rsquo; So he dressed himself as a poor man, and came secretly to the king&rsquo;s court, and was scarcely within the doors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and the princess left off weeping.</p></div> </div>
