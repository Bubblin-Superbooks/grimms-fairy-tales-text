When they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored so loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side and saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly. &lsquo;Ah, heavens,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;is it possible that my poor children whom he has swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?&rsquo; Then the kid had to run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the goat cut open the monster&rsquo;s stomach, and hardly had she made one cut, than one little kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six sprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered no injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them down whole. What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother, and jumped like a tailor at his wedding.</p></div> </div>
