The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went back and said to Gretel: &lsquo;Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us,&rsquo; and he lay down again in his bed.
