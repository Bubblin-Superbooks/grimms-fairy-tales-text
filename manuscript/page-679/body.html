<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I have been lucky enough to find it, and have brought it with me; but the heat of the sun scorches so that it begins to wither, and I don&rsquo;t know that I can carry it farther.&rsquo;</p><p>When the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad, they longed to taste it, and said, &lsquo;Dear countryman, let us just taste it.&rsquo; &lsquo;To be sure,&rsquo; answered he; &lsquo;I have two heads of it with me, and will give you one&rsquo;; so he opened his bag and gave them the bad. Then the witch herself took it into the kitchen to be dressed; and when it was ready she could not wait till it was carried up, but took a few leaves immediately and put them in her mouth, and scarcely were they swallowed when she lost her own form and ran braying down into the court in the form of an ass.</p></div> </div>
