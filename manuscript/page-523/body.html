<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&lsquo;Dear children,&rsquo; said a poor man to his four sons, &lsquo;I have nothing to give you; you must go out into the wide world and try your luck. Begin by learning some craft or another, and see how you can get on.&rsquo; So the four brothers took their walking-sticks in their hands, and their little bundles on their shoulders, and after bidding their father goodbye, went all out at the gate together. When they had got on some way they came to four crossways, each leading to a different country. Then the eldest said, &lsquo;Here we must part; but this day four years we will come back to this spot, and in the meantime each must try what he can do for himself.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
