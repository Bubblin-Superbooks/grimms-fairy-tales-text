<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called out, &lsquo;Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.&rsquo; But the carter, grumbling to himself, &lsquo;You make it the worse for me, indeed! what can you do?&rsquo; cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor dog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. &lsquo;There,&rsquo; cried the sparrow, &lsquo;thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now mind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.&rsquo; &lsquo;Do your worst, and welcome,&rsquo; said the brute, &lsquo;what harm can you do me?&rsquo; and passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then all the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it.</p></div> </div>
