<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&rsquo; &lsquo;Is that all?&rsquo; said the fox. &lsquo;I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will teach you how people get away from the hounds.&rsquo; Just then came a hunter with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. &lsquo;Open your sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,&rsquo; cried the cat to him, but the dogs had already seized him, and were holding him fast. &lsquo;Ah, Mr Fox,&rsquo; cried the cat. &lsquo;You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
