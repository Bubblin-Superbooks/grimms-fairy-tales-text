<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Now it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer, passed through the country where this king reigned: and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman, who asked him where he was going. &lsquo;I hardly know where I am going, or what I had better do,&rsquo; said the soldier; &lsquo;but I think I should like very well to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time I might be a king.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the old dame, &lsquo;that is no very hard task: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the princesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves you pretend to be fast asleep.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
