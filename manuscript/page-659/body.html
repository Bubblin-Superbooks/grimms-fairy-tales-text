Then she felt for the little piece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there, and she saw she had lost the gift of the good stars. What was to be done? She wanted to save her brothers, and had no key of the castle of the glass-mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her pocket and cut off her little finger, that was just the size of the piece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door and opened it.</p><p>As she went in, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, &lsquo;What are you seeking for?&rsquo; &lsquo;I seek for my brothers, the seven ravens,&rsquo; answered she.</p></div> </div>
