<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and one day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling waves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was dragged away deep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish. But the fish said, &lsquo;Pray let me live! I am not a real fish; I am an enchanted prince: put me in the water again, and let me go!&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, ho!&rsquo; said the man, &lsquo;you need not make so many words about the matter; I will have nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so swim away, sir, as soon as you please!&rsquo; Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted straight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him on the wave.</p></div> </div>
