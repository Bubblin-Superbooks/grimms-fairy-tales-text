<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When the king returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and wished him joy of his victory. &lsquo;I am not the one who carried away the victory,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but a strange knight who came to my assistance with his soldiers.&rsquo; The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was, but the king did not know, and said: &lsquo;He followed the enemy, and I did not see him again.&rsquo; She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but he smiled, and said: &lsquo;He has just come home on his three-legged horse, and the others have been mocking him, and crying: &ldquo;Here comes our hobblety jib back again!&rdquo; They asked, too: &ldquo;Under what hedge have you been lying sleeping all the time?&rdquo; So he said: &ldquo;I did the best of all, and it would have gone badly without me.&rdquo; And then he was still more ridiculed.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
