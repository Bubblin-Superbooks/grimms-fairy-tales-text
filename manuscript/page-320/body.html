But as the roast meat smelt so good, Gretel thought: &lsquo;Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!&rsquo; She touched it with her finger, and said: &lsquo;Ah! how good fowls are! It certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right time!&rsquo; She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with his guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought: &lsquo;One of the wings is burning! I had better take it off and eat it.&rsquo; So she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she thought: &lsquo;The other must go down too, or else master will observe that something is missing.&rsquo; When the two wings were eaten, she went and looked for her master, and did not see him.</p></div> </div>
