<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &lsquo;If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be able to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with it; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what can I wish for more?&rsquo; When he came to an inn, he halted, ate up all his bread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer. When he had rested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother&rsquo;s village. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at last, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than an hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth. &lsquo;I can find a cure for this,&rsquo; thought he; &lsquo;now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst&rsquo;: so he tied her to the stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop was to be had.</p></div> </div>
