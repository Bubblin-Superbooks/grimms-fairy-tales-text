<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> my master has forgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I can no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I have of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so.&rsquo;</p><p>However, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, &lsquo;I will help you; lie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be dead.&rsquo; The horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the lion who lived in a cave close by, and said to him, &lsquo;A little way off lies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent meal of his carcase.</p></div> </div>
