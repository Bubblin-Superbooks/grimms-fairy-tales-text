The peasant made the raven prophesy still more, and said: &lsquo;Thirdly, he says that there is some salad on the bed.&rsquo; &lsquo;That would be a fine thing!&rsquo; cried the miller, and went there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven once more till he croaked, and said: &lsquo;Fourthly, he says that there are some cakes under the bed.&rsquo; &lsquo;That would be a fine thing!&rsquo; cried the miller, and looked there, and found the cakes.</p><p>And now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller&rsquo;s wife was frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with her.</p></div> </div>
