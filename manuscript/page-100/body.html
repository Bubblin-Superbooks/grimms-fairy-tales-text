But the sparrow sat on the outside of the window, and cried &lsquo;Carter! thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life!&rsquo; With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet, and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the window. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and cried, &lsquo;Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!&rsquo; Then he became mad and blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture, glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without touching the bird at all.</p></div> </div>
