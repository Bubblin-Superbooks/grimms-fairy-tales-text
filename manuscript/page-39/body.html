<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring him milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry? Hans had not thought of looking to that.</p><p>While he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very clumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he lay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a pig in a wheelbarrow. &lsquo;What is the matter with you, my man?&rsquo; said the butcher, as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened, how he was dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too. Then the butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, &lsquo;There, drink and refresh yourself; your cow will give you no milk: don&rsquo;t you see she is an old beast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?&rsquo; &lsquo;</p></div> </div>
