<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful house, and the peasants said: &lsquo;The small peasant has certainly been to the place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in shovels.&rsquo; Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and bidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered: &lsquo;I sold my cow&rsquo;s skin in the town, for three hundred talers.&rsquo; When the peasants heard that, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed all their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in the town to the greatest advantage. The mayor, however, said: &lsquo;But my servant must go first.&rsquo; When she came to the merchant in the town, he did not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others came, he did not give them so much, and said: &lsquo;What can I do with all these skins?&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
