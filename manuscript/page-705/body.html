Then he said: &lsquo;Ha, ha, that is certainly my little cousin, who died only a few days ago,&rsquo; and he beckoned with his finger, and cried: &lsquo;Come, little cousin, come.&rsquo; They placed the coffin on the ground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay therein. He felt his face, but it was cold as ice. &lsquo;Wait,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I will warm you a little,&rsquo; and went to the fire and warmed his hand and laid it on the dead man&rsquo;s face, but he remained cold. Then he took him out, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his arms that the blood might circulate again.</p></div> </div>
