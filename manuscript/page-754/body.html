When the dance was over, the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well, that he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom he saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got there, he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened when he heard the order, and said to Cat-skin, &lsquo;You must have let a hair fall into the soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating.&rsquo; Then he went before the king, and he asked him who had cooked the soup. &lsquo;I did,&rsquo; answered the cook. But the king said, &lsquo;That is not true; it was better done than you could do it.</p></div> </div>
