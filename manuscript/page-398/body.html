<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And when she had grown up her father said: &lsquo;We will get her married.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the mother, &lsquo;if only someone would come who would have her.&rsquo; At length a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans; but he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said the father, &lsquo;she has plenty of good sense&rsquo;; and the mother said: &lsquo;Oh, she can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Hans, &lsquo;if she is not really smart, I won&rsquo;t have her.&rsquo; When they were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: &lsquo;Elsie, go into the cellar and fetch some beer.</p></div> </div>
