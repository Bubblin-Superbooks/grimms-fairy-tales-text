Then said a straw, &lsquo;I will lay myself across, and you may pass over upon me.&rsquo; But as the mice were going over, the straw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in and were drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood came and said, &lsquo;I am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream, and you shall pass over upon me.&rsquo; So he laid himself down; but they managed so clumsily, that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the stream. Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly offered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream; and this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse, and managed to get Partlet out of it;</p></div> </div>
