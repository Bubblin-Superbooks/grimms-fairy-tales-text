The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: &lsquo;That is the first thief,&rsquo; and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said to his comrade outside: &lsquo;The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he said I was the first.&rsquo; The second did not want to go in at all, but was forced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: &lsquo;Grete, that is the second.&rsquo; This servant was equally alarmed, and he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better, for the peasant again said: &lsquo;Grete, that is the third.</p></div> </div>
