And they flew down into the ashes; and the little doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and then the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put all the good grain into the dishes, and left all the ashes. Before half an hour&rsquo;s time all was done, and out they flew again. And then Ashputtel took the dishes to her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball. But her mother said, &lsquo;It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no clothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame&rsquo;: and off she went with her two daughters to the ball.</p></div> </div>
