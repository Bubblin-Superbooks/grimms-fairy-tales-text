<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>After they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin walking together along the road: and the needle cried out, &lsquo;Stop, stop!&rsquo; and said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such dirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his friend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat drinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore that the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their carriage. Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows, and not likely to take up much room, told them they might ride, but made them promise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in, nor to tread on Partlet&rsquo;s toes.</p></div> </div>
