The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that exception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only happens once every few years, you will let me go, won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; &lsquo;Top-off! Half-done!&rsquo; answered the mouse, &lsquo;they are such odd names, they make me very thoughtful.&rsquo; &lsquo;You sit at home,&rsquo; said the cat, &lsquo;in your dark-grey fur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that&rsquo;s because you do not go out in the daytime.&rsquo; During the cat&rsquo;s absence the mouse cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely emptied the pot of fat.</p></div> </div>
