You look quite out of spirits!&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah, me!&rsquo; said the cat, &lsquo;how can one be in good spirits when one&rsquo;s life is in danger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress laid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky enough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.</p></div> </div>
