They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right, wherever his legs took him.</p><p>In the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the procession he said: &lsquo;For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you running across the fields after this young man? Is that seemly?&rsquo; At the same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away, but as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself obliged to run behind.</p></div> </div>
