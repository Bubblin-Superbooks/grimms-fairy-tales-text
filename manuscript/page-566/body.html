<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It was only a dream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.&rsquo; &lsquo;The dream may have been true,&rsquo; said the king. &lsquo;I will give you a piece of advice. Fill your pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in the pocket, and then if you are carried away again, they will fall out and leave a track in the streets.&rsquo; But unseen by the king, the manikin was standing beside him when he said that, and heard all. At night when the sleeping princess was again carried through the streets, some peas certainly did fall out of her pocket, but they made no track, for the crafty manikin had just before scattered peas in every street there was. And again the princess was compelled to do servant&rsquo;s work until cock-crow.</p></div> </div>
