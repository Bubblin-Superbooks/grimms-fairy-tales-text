As he drew near, the raven said, &lsquo;I am by birth a king&rsquo;s daughter, but am now under the spell of some enchantment; you can, however, set me free.&rsquo; &lsquo;What am I to do?&rsquo; he asked. She replied, &lsquo;Go farther into the wood until you come to a house, wherein lives an old woman; she will offer you food and drink, but you must not take of either; if you do, you will fall into a deep sleep, and will not be able to help me. In the garden behind the house is a large tan-heap, and on that you must stand and watch for me.</p></div> </div>
