Then the four brothers said to each other, &lsquo;Here is a chance for us; let us try what we can do.&rsquo; And they agreed to see whether they could not set the princess free. &lsquo;I will soon find out where she is, however,&rsquo; said the star-gazer, as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried out, &lsquo;I see her afar off, sitting upon a rock in the sea, and I can spy the dragon close by, guarding her.&rsquo; Then he went to the king, and asked for a ship for himself and his brothers; and they sailed together over the sea, till they came to the right place.</p></div> </div>
