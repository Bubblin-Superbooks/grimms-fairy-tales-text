<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer because of the many wounds which he had received. The king said to him: &lsquo;You may return to your home, I need you no longer, and you will not receive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me service for them.&rsquo; Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living, went away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the evening he entered a forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light, which he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. &lsquo;Do give me one night&rsquo;s lodging, and a little to eat and drink,&rsquo; said he to her, &lsquo;or I shall starve.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oho!&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;who gives anything to a run-away soldier? Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you will do what I wish.</p></div> </div>
