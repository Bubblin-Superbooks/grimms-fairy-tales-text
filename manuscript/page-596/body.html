He was astonished at this and called out: &lsquo;Hi! your reverence, whither away so quickly? Do not forget that we have a christening today!&rsquo; and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but was also held fast to it.</p><p>Whilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers came with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them and begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were seven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.</p></div> </div>
