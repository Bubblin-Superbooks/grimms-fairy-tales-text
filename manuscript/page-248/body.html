<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into partnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well; they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add considerably to their stores. The bird&rsquo;s duty was to fly daily into the wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw to the cooking.</p><p>When people are too well off they always begin to long for something new. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a fellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his household arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed at home and had a good time of it.</p></div> </div>
