<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a good joke!&rsquo; said Chanticleer; &lsquo;no, that will never do; I had rather by half walk home; I&rsquo;ll sit on the box and be coachman, if you like, but I&rsquo;ll not draw.&rsquo; While this was passing, a duck came quacking up and cried out, &lsquo;You thieving vagabonds, what business have you in my grounds? I&rsquo;ll give it you well for your insolence!&rsquo; and upon that she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily. But Chanticleer was no coward, and returned the duck&rsquo;s blows with his sharp spurs so fiercely that she soon began to cry out for mercy; which was only granted her upon condition that she would draw the carriage home for them. This she agreed to do; and Chanticleer got upon the box, and drove, crying, &lsquo;Now, duck, get on as fast as you can.&rsquo; And away they went at a pretty good pace.</p></div> </div>
