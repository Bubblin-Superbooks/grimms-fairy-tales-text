On the way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings, and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. But as the weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could go no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. The miller&rsquo;s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: &lsquo;Lay yourself on the straw there,&rsquo; and gave him a slice of bread and cheese. The peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman thought: &lsquo;He is tired and has gone to sleep.&rsquo; In the meantime came the parson; the miller&rsquo;s wife received him well, and said: &lsquo;My husband is out, so we will have a feast.</p></div> </div>
