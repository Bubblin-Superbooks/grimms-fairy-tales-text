<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &lsquo;Are you the knight who came every day to the festival, always in different colours, and who caught the three golden apples?&rsquo; asked the king. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; answered he, &lsquo;and here the apples are,&rsquo; and he took them out of his pocket, and returned them to the king. &lsquo;If you desire further proof, you may see the wound which your people gave me when they followed me. But I am likewise the knight who helped you to your victory over your enemies.&rsquo; &lsquo;If you can perform such deeds as that, you are no gardener&rsquo;s boy; tell me, who is your father?&rsquo; &lsquo;My father is a mighty king, and gold have I in plenty as great as I require.&rsquo; &lsquo;I well see,&rsquo; said the king, &lsquo;that I owe my thanks to you; can I do anything to please you?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; answered he, &lsquo;that indeed you can. Give me your daughter to wife.</p></div> </div>
