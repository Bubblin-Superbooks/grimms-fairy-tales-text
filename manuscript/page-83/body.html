So he asked his kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and neighbours. But the queen said, &lsquo;I will have the fairies also, that they might be kind and good to our little daughter.&rsquo; Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom; but as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat out of, they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her. So twelve fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, and red shoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand: and after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all their best gifts to the little princess.</p></div> </div>
