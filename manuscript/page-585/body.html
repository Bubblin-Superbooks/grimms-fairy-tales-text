<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Looking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he called out to them, &lsquo;God be with you.&rsquo; They stopped when they heard the call, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their fighting, which now became more furious. &lsquo;God be with you,&rsquo; he cried again, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went back to their fighting. A third time he called out, &lsquo;God be with you,&rsquo; and then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between the three men, he went out and asked them why they were fighting so angrily with one another. One of them said that he had found a stick, and that he had but to strike it against any door through which he wished to pass, and it immediately flew open.</p></div> </div>
