Thus it is with proud silly people, who think themselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take advice.</p><p>When the second prince had thus been gone a long time, the youngest son said he would go and search for the Water of Life, and trusted he should soon be able to make his father well again. So he set out, and the dwarf met him too at the same spot in the valley, among the mountains, and said, &lsquo;Prince, whither so fast?&rsquo; And the prince said, &lsquo;I am going in search of the Water of Life, because my father is ill, and like to die: can you help me? Pray be kind, and aid me if you can!&rsquo; &lsquo;Do you know where it is to be found?&rsquo; asked the dwarf.</p></div> </div>
