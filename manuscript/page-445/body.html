<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The ant-king had come in the night with thousands and thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had by great industry picked up all the millet-seed and gathered them into the sacks.</p><p>Presently the king&rsquo;s daughter herself came down into the garden, and was amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him. But she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said: &lsquo;Although he has performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband until he had brought me an apple from the Tree of Life.&rsquo; The youth did not know where the Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and would have gone on for ever, as long as his legs would carry him, though he had no hope of finding it. After he had wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to a wood, and lay down under a tree to sleep. But he heard a rustling in the branches, and a golden apple fell into his hand.</p></div> </div>
