<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Now the servant-maid came into the kitchen, and seeing the salad ready, was going to carry it up; but on the way she too felt a wish to taste it as the old woman had done, and ate some leaves; so she also was turned into an ass and ran after the other, letting the dish with the salad fall on the ground. The messenger sat all this time with the beautiful young lady, and as nobody came with the salad and she longed to taste it, she said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know where the salad can be.&rsquo; Then he thought something must have happened, and said, &lsquo;I will go into the kitchen and see.&rsquo; And as he went he saw two asses in the court running about, and the salad lying on the ground. &lsquo;All right!&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;those two have had their share.</p></div> </div>
