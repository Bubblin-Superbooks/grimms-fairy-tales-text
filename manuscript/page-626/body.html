<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There was, however, a servant of the king&rsquo;s who favoured the huntsmen, and when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went to them and repeated everything, and said: &lsquo;The lion wants to make the king believe that you are girls.&rsquo; Then the king&rsquo;s daughter thanked him, and said to her maidens: &lsquo;Show some strength, and step firmly on the peas.&rsquo; So next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called before him, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they stepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not one of the peas either rolled or stirred. Then they went away again, and the king said to the lion: &lsquo;You have lied to me, they walk just like men.&rsquo; The lion said: &lsquo;They have been informed that they were going to be put to the test, and have assumed some strength.</p></div> </div>
