The miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into the middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the miser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in the air. The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung in rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that the blood ran down. &lsquo;Oh, for heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rsquo; cried the miser, &lsquo;Master! master! pray let the fiddle alone. What have I done to deserve this?&rsquo; &lsquo;Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough,&rsquo; said the other; &lsquo;thou art only meeting thy reward&rsquo;: so he played up another tune.</p></div> </div>
