<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and when their parents again brought food they said: &lsquo;We will not so much as touch one fly&rsquo;s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been here and has insulted us!&rsquo; Then the old King said: &lsquo;Be easy, he shall be punished,&rsquo; and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear&rsquo;s cave, and called in: &lsquo;Old Growler, why have you insulted my children? You shall suffer for it&mdash;we will punish you by a bloody war.&rsquo; Thus war was announced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take part in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth contained. And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the air, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and flies had to come.</p></div> </div>
