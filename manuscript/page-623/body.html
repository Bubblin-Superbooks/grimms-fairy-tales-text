His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted so much about his faithfulness that she nearly died. Then her father said to her: &lsquo;Dearest child, why are you so sad? You shall have whatsoever you will.&rsquo; She thought for a moment and said: &lsquo;Dear father, I wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face, figure, and size.&rsquo; The father said: &lsquo;If it be possible, your desire shall be fulfilled,&rsquo; and he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom, until eleven young maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in face, figure, and size.</p></div> </div>
