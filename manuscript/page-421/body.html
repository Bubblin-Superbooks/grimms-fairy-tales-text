Ashputtel&rsquo;s two sisters were asked to come; so they called her up, and said, &lsquo;Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie our sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king&rsquo;s feast.&rsquo; Then she did as she was told; but when all was done she could not help crying, for she thought to herself, she should so have liked to have gone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard to let her go.</p></div> </div>
