<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Some men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes right&mdash;all that falls to them is so much gain&mdash;all their geese are swans&mdash;all their cards are trumps&mdash;toss them which way you will, they will always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so much the faster. The world may very likely not always think of them as they think of themselves, but what care they for the world? what can it know about the matter?</p><p>One of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans. Seven long years he had worked hard for his master. At last he said, &lsquo;Master, my time is up; I must go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages and let me go.&rsquo; And the master said, &lsquo;You have been a faithful and good servant, Hans, so your pay shall be handsome.&rsquo; Then he gave him a lump of silver as big as his head.</p></div> </div>
