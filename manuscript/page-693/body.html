Just come back to me early in the morning.&rsquo; Then the youth went to the gallows, sat down beneath it, and waited till evening came. And as he was cold, he lighted himself a fire, but at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire, he could not get warm. And as the wind knocked the hanged men against each other, and they moved backwards and forwards, he thought to himself: &lsquo;If you shiver below by the fire, how those up above must freeze and suffer!&rsquo; And as he felt pity for them, he raised the ladder, and climbed up, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven.</p></div> </div>
