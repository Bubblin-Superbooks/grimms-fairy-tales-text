<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to herself: &lsquo;He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the world,&rsquo; she spoke to him in a friendly way. &lsquo;Good day, dear Mr Fox, how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard times?&rsquo; The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give any answer or not. At last he said: &lsquo;Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How many arts do you understand?&rsquo; &lsquo;I understand but one,&rsquo; replied the cat, modestly. &lsquo;What art is that?&rsquo; asked the fox. &lsquo;When the hounds are following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.</p></div> </div>
