You are already two too many for me; can you not think of something better?&rsquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be impatient,&rsquo; said Snow-white, &lsquo;I will help you,&rsquo; and she pulled her scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard.</p><p>As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay amongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted it up, grumbling to himself: &lsquo;Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my fine beard. Bad luck to you!&rsquo; and then he swung the bag upon his back, and went off without even once looking at the children.</p></div> </div>
