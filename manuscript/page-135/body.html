<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies to discover who was the enemy&rsquo;s commander-in-chief. The gnat, who was the most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled, and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be announced. There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him and said: &lsquo;Fox, you are the most cunning of all animals, you shall be general and lead us.&rsquo; &lsquo;Good,&rsquo; said the fox, &lsquo;but what signal shall we agree upon?&rsquo; No one knew that, so the fox said: &lsquo;I have a fine long bushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers. When I lift my tail up quite high, all is going well, and you must charge; but if I let it hang down, run away as fast as you can.</p></div> </div>
