<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two talers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that the doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly have been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length inquired if he too could not be a doctor. &lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; said the doctor, &lsquo;that is soon managed.&rsquo; &lsquo;What must I do?&rsquo; asked the peasant. &lsquo;In the first place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on the frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into money, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to medicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words: &ldquo;I am Doctor Knowall,&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
