The boy cried a second time: &lsquo;What do you want here?&mdash;speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the steps!&rsquo; The sexton thought: &lsquo;He can&rsquo;t mean to be as bad as his words,&rsquo; uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boy called to him for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose, he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell down the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon he rang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went to bed, and fell asleep. The sexton&rsquo;s wife waited a long time for her husband, but he did not come back. At length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy, and asked: &lsquo;Do you know where my husband is? He climbed up the tower before you did.</p></div> </div>
