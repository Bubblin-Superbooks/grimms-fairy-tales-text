<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the prince, &lsquo;I do not. Pray tell me if you know.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then as you have spoken to me kindly, and are wise enough to seek for advice, I will tell you how and where to go. The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and, that you may be able to reach it in safety, I will give you an iron wand and two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three times with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying down inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they will let you pass; then hasten on to the well, and take some of the Water of Life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer the door will shut upon you for ever.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
