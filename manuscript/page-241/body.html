Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and cried: &lsquo;Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon be fat.&rsquo; Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was Hansel&rsquo;s finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. &lsquo;Now, then, Gretel,&rsquo; she cried to the girl, &lsquo;stir yourself, and bring some water. Let Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.&rsquo; Ah, how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how her tears did flow down her cheeks! &lsquo;Dear God, do help us,&rsquo; she cried.</p></div> </div>
