<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in my golden cup.&rsquo; But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily than before: &lsquo;Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.&rsquo; Then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay down, and held her head over the running stream, and cried and said, &lsquo;What will become of me?&rsquo; And the lock of hair answered her again:</p><p>And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom, and floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did not see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the charm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that she had lost the hair.</p></div> </div>
