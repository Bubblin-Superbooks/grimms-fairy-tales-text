<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Next morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant called the cow-herd in and said: &lsquo;Look, I have a little calf there, but it is still small and has to be carried.&rsquo; The cow-herd said: &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set it among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like one which was eating, and the cow-herd said: &lsquo;It will soon run by itself, just look how it eats already!&rsquo; At night when he was going to drive the herd home again, he said to the calf: &lsquo;If you can stand there and eat your fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don&rsquo;t care to drag you home again in my arms.&rsquo; But the little peasant stood at his door, and waited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through the village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was.</p></div> </div>
