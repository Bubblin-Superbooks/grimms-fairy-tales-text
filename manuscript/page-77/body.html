<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: &lsquo;Dear friends, from whence do you come here?&rsquo; The coal replied: &lsquo;I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain,&mdash;I should have been burnt to ashes.&rsquo; The bean said: &lsquo;I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.</p></div> </div>
